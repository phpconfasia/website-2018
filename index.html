                                            as var_dump() in your code. They are also cheaper than manual tests and easier to implement than you may think.</p>
                                        <p>The attendees of this full-day workshop will learn how to write and execute tests as well as how to integrate automated tests into their development process.</p>

                                        <p>ML is for people with PhD, right? Actually, no. ML is for regular developers too! You can make use from “pre-baked” trained models that Google offers through their set of APIs, or even train a custom model with Auto ML without knowing anything about Machine Learning or TensorFlow code. After all, it’s just an API call!</p>

                                        <p>Going viral hasn't always been considered good. Whether you're fighting the common cold, or trying to remove the ILOVEYOU computer worm from your corporate file server, two things are certain: your immune system is based on your gut health, and computers have really poor gut health.</p>

                                        <p>Stopping viruses is hard. The main reason for this is that viruses are really clever. They've evolved over time to escape detection. Each previously detected virus allows the next iteration of the virus to become more resilient. The second reason is that your computer's gut health has to fight every virus, whereas each virus just has to find one immuno-compromised system to survive.</p>

                                        <p>Let's work out how viruses hide. How to they sneak past the checkpoints. How they attach themselves to your system. How they fight detection, and removal. We'll look at aspects such as self-replication, cryptographic obfuscation, and touch on methods of delivery and infection.</p>

                                        <p>Now that you're thinking like a virus writer, you can anticipate which areas of your applications need hardening. Just remember, we're doing it for good, not profit :)</p>

                                        <p>This presentation will feature live demos of writing PHP viruses, and infection of willing targets. The theories apply equally to many languages, so an understanding of PHP is not required.</p>

                                        <h5>About the speaker</h5>

                                        <p>Ben Dechrai is a technologist, presenter, author, and hard and-core privacy advocate. When he's not on stage, or sharing his ideas and views on privacy, security, and software development, he applies these passions to the architecture and design of software systems for businesses of all sizes.</p>

                                        <p>His staunch support of civil liberties saw him launch a national campaign in Australia to fight against the 2016 Census debacle. He's now working on the design and creation of privacy-respecting IoT systems for home automation.</p>

                                        <p>With what spare time he has, Ben enjoys bringing communities together, by running a number of events throughout the year, from conferences and meetups, to end-of-year parties and comedy shows.</p>

                                        <p>Frameworks are very helpful to solve common problems when developing an application. But what happens if we have to move to a new version or another framework? In this talk I will show how my company tries to keep independent of any framework, decoupling our business logic from symfony.</p>

                                        <p>We are wondering about reactive programming. Why is everyone getting crazy with it? What does reactive programming exactly mean? What are the benefits of reactive programming? And, finally, should we learn it?</p>

                                        <p>I've written event sourced applications with prooph for a while now, after some time I realized, that there is some boilerplate I need to write again and again. Boring stuff that leads to errors pretty quickly, because I'm not paying attention that much on repetitive boilerplate code I need to write. Also I realized that I don't need my favourite framework that much anymore and when creating some small microservices (like one for each aggregate), their need really disappears. Let me invite you to yet another journey, from standard application framework scenarios, to microservices and how functional programming and code generators can make a difference to eliminate so much boilerplate, that your applications are getting slimmer and slimmer.</p>

                                        <p>Before composer, we downloaded packages manually. But how do you upgrade to newer framework version? Still manually?</p>

                                        <p>In non-PHP world, Google and Facebook already use such instant upgrade tools. Thanks to nikic/php-parser a door opened in PHP for such a tool ...and Rector was born.</p>

                                        <p>I’ll show you how Rector handles 80 % of boring upgrades for you - in 1 CLI command.</p>

                                        <p>We are very much obsessed or bound to use a fixed structural database design for our projects. The traditional column based table design along with normalization makes our life crippled within lots of tables and joins. The BLOB was there but was not flexible enough to be used everywhere. JSON is one of the most used structure for data transmission from one service to another and also storing in the database. It gives flexibility to store a structure data as a JSON object and performs operation on the JSON object through queries. Many developers are not aware of this great gem inside their database engine and end up creating larger tables with lots of columns or many tables to keep the database normalized. In this talk I want to focus on JSON data structure and PostgreSQL support for it. From my professional experience of scaling service for 20 million users and millions of records every day, I want to share the experience and how you can we work with it with a practical demo.</p>

                                        <h5>Logical Steps</h5>

                                        <p>Even now, many assume PHP is only synchronous and not capable of async processes, which is wrong. </p>

                                        <p>Asynchronous execution has several advantages. Letting you multitask on a single thread. That is cooperative multitasking.  Each running task gives the control back to the system when idle.  For example, waiting for an HTTP response or IO operation.</p>

                                        <p>All these are well and fine, but the asynchronous code is messy and hard to maintain. This presentation shows how to write async code in a synchronous fashion to get the best of both worlds.</p>

                                        <p>Generators with the yield keyword, are the most underused feature in PHP. It has great potential. We can take advantage of them by implementing async and await in PHP on our own!</p>

However the local storage can still be the bottleneck and predictable performance might come with a high price.

                                        <h6>MongoDB / Author of Xdebug</h6>

                                        <p>In this workshop, we take a first look at writing PHP extensions. Using step-by-step examples, we'll take a function written in PHP and convert them into a loadable extension using C. We'll then test both versions and compare the results. After seeing the size and scope of the benefits that can be realized with only a few minor changes, you'll want to try it out for yourself. You'll also understand why we start with simple things, and not try to rewrite all of Symfony in C.</p>

                                        <p>You've written a blog in 5 minutes, but what about a secure, encrypted communications application in 3 hours?</p>

                                        <p>This workshop will get you started with a simple Laravel application, and iteratively build it up to become an end-to-end encrypted chat platform.</p>

                                        <p>You'll learn how to get started quickly with Laravel and Bootstrap, add encryption layers to the system, design database structures that won't leak metadata, and even provide mechanisms for plausible deniability.</p>

                                        <p>Participants will benefit from having a moderate understanding of current PHP frameworks, MySQL/MariaDB, and be comfortable understanding JavaScript. You'll have VirtualBox pre-installed on your laptop, and will hopefully finish the workshop with a simple, yet fully functioning communications platform.</p>

                                        <h4>Junade Ali</h4>
                                        <h5>Cloudflare</h5>

                                        <p>It’s no secret that software is often written poorly. In commercial environments, developers will regularly find themselves facing technical debt and find that the ability to refactor code is an essential skill to master. As Martin Fowler famously wrote: "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."</p>

                                        <p>Due to bad design in software, delivering value to the client can become ever more difficult and stressful until bad software design decisions are rectified. For developers working on badly designed projects, making repayments on technical debt, whilst also delivering value is a key skill – this session will explain how it is possible to square-the-circle and both deliver value whilst paying down technical debt.</p>

                                        <p>Unfortunately far too many developers consider refactoring as a risky task filled with code that’s ridden with var_dumps and debug breakpoints. This session seeks to teach attendees that refactoring can be a safe, everyday task during normal software development and that it is indeed healthy to refactor software mercilessly, especially when operating in an Agile environment with changing software requirements.</p>

                                        <p>This session will feature a hands-on demonstration of how to refactor a legacy app through a combination of automated testing, faster releases and merciless refactoring.</p>

                                        <p>Practical experience in automated software testing and continuous integration are vital learning outcomes and this session seeks to expose attendees to tools like Docker, PHPUnit, Selenium and PHP Mess Detector. Beyond testing, we’ll cover the Code Smells that help developers weed out where the problematic code is.</p>

                                        <p>Gaining a firm grounding in Object-Oriented Programming when refactoring PHP is invaluable and as such, this session will take a deep-dive into Polymorphism, SOLID principles and anti-patterns. After nailing down Object-Orientation, we’ll discuss how we can move legacy software architecture to suitable Design Patterns.</p>

                                        <p>Extreme Programming practices will be presented as a key discussion point on how developers can help achieve these goals.</p>

                                        <p>PHPSpec and BDD are cool buzzwords this days in PHP community and I would like to invite you to show you how to build better code with it.</p>

                                        <p>I will be live coding few examples to introduce you to PHPSpec features, show you some caveats and by working in small teams build a feature together.</p>

                                        <p>So what is PHPSpec? It's a great tool to model (specify) and build your code that has a side effect: you get some tests out of it. It's not a drop in replacement for unit testing (or testing in general) but can help you out build great products in short amount of time.</p>

                                        <p>Every time I say that I don't use any framework on the projects I'm working on, people tell me I am crazy and that I should not reinvent the wheel. Crazy? Maybe! But reinventing the wheel: for sure not! I'm using a whole bunch of libraries and that is what they are meant to, it's not a framework argument!</p>

                                        <p>A crazy idea? Maybe not so much: Java, Python, Ruby, … they are all (good!) general purpose languages but they don't know about HTTP requests / responses at their core. Web Frameworks in those languages solve this and provide the missing HTTP/web features.</p>

                                        <p>PHP is very different from those as it is designed primarily for web development and it knows everything about HTTP sessions, requests, response, JSON, cookies, output buffering, … NATIVELY!</p>

                                        <p>In this workshop, we are going to investigate the building blocks of frameworks (Routing, MVC, Dependency Injection,…) leveraging features that PHP provides natively and how a project can be realized with PHP as the only framework while respecting principles like: “Don’t reinvent the wheel”, KISS, DRY, YAGNI, …</p>

                                        <p>Drupal is an enterprise-grade open source content management system (CMS). The vanilla install is capable of handling content structure, content publishing workflow, layout, user and permission management. The functionality can be easily extended by installing contributed modules. Besides content-based site, Drupal can be configured as e-commerce, social networking, intranet, lightweight CRM or custom business process web application. Drupal 8 is the latest version and is built on top of Symfony.</p>

                                        <p>In this workshop, participants will set up Drupal site from scratch, configure and develop an application, and deploy it to a production-ready server. A topic from <a href="https://archkatas.herokuapp.com/kata.html" target="_blank">https://archkatas.herokuapp.com/kata.html</a> will be used to help define the requirement of the site.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is a modern city-state and island country in Southeast Asia. It lies off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula and is 137 kilometres (85 mi) north of the equator. The country's territory consists of the
                    diamond-shaped main island, commonly referred to as Singapore Island in English and Pulau Ujong in Malay, and more than 60 significantly smaller islets. Singapore is separated from Peninsular Malaysia by the Straits of Johor to the
                    north, and from Indonesia's Riau Islands by the Singapore Strait to the south. Singapore is highly urbanised. Land reclamation has been used to expand the country's land area.
